# ExceptionsAsCommunication
Using .Net Core / Recursion / Delegates / Xunit to prove that throwing custom exception hurts performance in your application

To run unit tests (this works on both mac and pc btw):
1. install Core https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started-with-dotnet-tutorial 
2. close visual studio, open up vs code.
3. open up terminal with ctrl + ~, type dotnet restore,
4. once packages are restored, in terminal, cd into Logic.Tests, then run dotnet test
5. observe why the test is failing!
